# ShakespaereFit

I made a website for ShakespaereFit, a personal training company. It consists of two webpages, the homepage and a shop page. The home page has a nav bar, embedded video, and an interactive form any user can fill out and submit. The shop page has a title and logo, product pictures, nav bar, and the same interactive form as the homepage. When your cusor passes over any product, a description with a price and buy now button appears. The buy now button links to the repp sports website to buy the item.
